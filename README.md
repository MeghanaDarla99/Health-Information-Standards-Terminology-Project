## Savvy Health Squad - Health Information Standards & Terminology Project
# Project Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for the INFO B-581 Spring 2024 course project, completed by Group 5, The Savvy Health Squad (Deepishka Pemmasani, Harika Mareddy, Meghana Darla, Priyankitha Kandi), under the supervision of Dr. Saptarshi Purkayastha at the Department of BioHealth Informatics, Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, IUPUI.
The project focuses on demonstrating interoperability between healthcare systems using standardized clinical terminologies, data formats, and API technologies. It is based on a hypothetical use case involving a 65-year-old patient diagnosed with hypertensive urgency, requiring seamless data exchange between an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system (OpenMRS) and a Nursing Documentation System (OpenELIS).

This is aimed at achieving seamless data exchange between healthcare systems. This project demonstrates interoperability principles, focusing on HL7 standards, CDA document transformations, XSLT workflows, and real-time API interactions.

# Project Objectives
Standardized Terminologies: Utilize LOINC, SNOMED CT, ICD-10, RxNorm, and NDC to represent clinical concepts such as symptoms, diagnoses, and medications (Sprint 1).
System Modeling: Design UML and BPMN diagrams to model system interactions and processes (Sprint 2).
Interoperability: Achieve semantic and syntactic interoperability between OpenMRS (System A) and OpenELIS (System B) using HL7, FHIR, and XSLT transformations (Sprint 4).
Practical Demonstration: Convert C-CDA documents to JSON, post data to systems via REST APIs using Postman, and verify bidirectional data exchange (Sprint 5).
# Use Case
A 65-year-old male patient presents with a headache and is diagnosed with hypertensive urgency (BP 190/130 mmHg). He is a chronic smoker, non-alcoholic, with a family history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The clinician prescribes 0.2 mg clonidine, admits the patient to the hospital, and instructs nurses to monitor blood pressure every 4 hours. All data is recorded in OpenMRS, and nursing observations are updated in OpenELIS, with bidirectional data exchange ensured.
